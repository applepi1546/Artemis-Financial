# Artemis-Financial

- ### Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
  	The client, Artemis Financial, hopes to seek advice from Global Rain to modernize and improve the organization's security and protect their data and information from outside threats. For a finance company like Artemis Financial, the importance of secure communication must be considered. The confidentiality of customer data is paramount; with essential information like savings and investment plans as part of their databases, it's vital to protect the information to prevent breaches of trust from customers and avoid potential lawsuits. Secure communications ensure that client information and personal details are well insulated, will help gain customers' confidence, and will prevent lawsuits from other customers for data breaches. Furthermore, secure communication could bring many potential customers as the customer understands how much Artemis Financial values their customer and their security privacy.
  
- ### What did you do well when finding your client's software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company's overall well-being?
  When I was doing the manual review for the coding assessment, I understood the vulnerability graphic. Through the graphic, I was able to analyze and manually review the code and identify the problem and potential exploitation that could be taken advantage of. I was able to develop a mitigation technique that helps prevent the exploitation from happening. It's important to code securely as secure coding helps prevent hacking and data breaches; for a company like Artemis, where customers' financial information is stored, adding software security helps prevent any data breaches.  

- ### What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
  The part of the vulnerability assessment I found highly tricky was encapsulations; I understand what encapsulation is and how it's a part of OOP. However, I needed help identifying encapsulation as part of the potential vulnerability. I need help telling if there are problems with encapsulation or if an encapsulation should be there or not. I was able to understand this better as the class took place, and I was able to understand more about encapsulation and how it works.

- ### How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
  I was able to increase security by adding hashing and adding input validations. Furthermore, I also created a keystore that made a certificate that helps validate HTTP communications, ensuring communication between clients is secure. In the future, to assess vulnerability, it would be good to use a dependency checker to scan for issues and vulnerabilities. Scanning allows me to analyze the result and determine how to make my code more secure and better. 

- ### How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
  I made sure the code and applications were functional and secure by running a dependency checker; this will tell me if there are any vulnerabilities that I potentially introduced by adding my code. To ensure I did not raise any new potential vulnerability before coding, I ran a dependency check; this tells me the original number of dependencies that existed before coding. After coding and performing a manual coding check, I reran the dependency checker and did not see any new vulnerability; this means I did not add any vulnerability after coding my things. 
  
- ### What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
  One resource that I found extremely helpful through this class, which I will probably use in future projects, personal or school-related, is the vulnerability assessment diagram. This diagram helped me understand the potential vulnerability that could occur in my code; this is extremely useful for manual coding review and to use and keep in mind while coding a new project as it helps with making sure what I need to keep in mind and secure in my applications.
  
- ### Employers sometimes ask for examples of work you have completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What do you think you might show future employers from this assignment?
    I learned a lot from this project, and there are many things I can show my future employer based on this project. One of the things I can show them is my ability to assess code and, from the assessment, perform a manual coding review and develop a solution to mitigate the problem. Furthermore, I can show them. I know how to run a dependency checker to find potential vulnerabilities and suppress/resolve the vulnerability.
