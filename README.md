# Artemis-Financial

- ### Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
  	The client, Artemis Financial, is hoping to seek advice from Global Rain to find ways to modernize and improve the organization's security and protect their data and information from outside threats. For a finance company like Artemis Financial, the importance of secure communication cannot be disregarded. The confidentiality of customer data is extremely important; with important information like savings and investment plans as part of their databases, it’s important to protect the information to prevent breaches of trust from customers and avoid potential lawsuits. Secure communications make sure that client information and personal details are well protected will help with gaining customers’ trust and preventing lawsuits from other customers for data breaches. Furthermore, secure communication could bring many potential customers as the customer understands how much Artemis Financial values their customer and their security privacy.
  
- ### What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
  When I was doing the manual review for the coding assessment, I was able to understand the vulnerability graphic, and through the graphic, I was able to analyze and manually review the code and identify the problem and potential exploitation that could be taken advantage of. I was able to develop a mitigation technique that helps prevent the exploitation from happening. It's important to code securely as secure coding helps prevent hacking and data breaches; for a company like Artemis, where customers' financial information is stored, adding software security helps with preventing any data breaches.  

- ### What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
  The part of the vulnerability assessment I found extremely tricky for me personally was encapsulations, I understand what encapsulation is and how it's a part of OOP. However, I really struggled with identifying encapsulation as part of the potential vulnerability. It's difficult for me to tell if there are problems with encapsulation or if an encapsulation should be there or not. This is something I was able to understand better as the class took place, and I was able to understand more about encapsulation and how it works.

- ### How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
  I was able to increase security by adding hashing and adding input validations. Furthermore, I also created a keystore that created a certificate that helps validation HTTP communications, making sure communication between server-client is secure. In the future, in order to assess vulnerability, it would be good to use a dependency checker to scan for issues and vulnerabilities. Through the scanning, I can then analyze the result and determine to how make my code more secure and better. 

- ### How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
  
  
- ### What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
- ### Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
